<h3>Game Objective:</h3>
<li>Players aim to reduce their opponent's life points to 0 by battling with monsters or inflicting direct damage.</li>

<h3>Setup:</h3>
<li>Each player starts with 8000 life points and a deck of 42 cards.</li>
<li>Players draw an opening hand of 5 cards.</li>

<h3>Monsters:</h3>
<li>All monsters in Mistix have levels ranging from 1 to 8.</li>
<li>Level 8 monsters are the ultimate form of each creature and have 99,000 attack and defense points.</li>
<li>Players can fuse monsters of the same level to create one with a higher level.</li>

<h3>Battle Mechanics:</h3>
<li>Monsters cannot attack on the turn they are summoned.</li><br>
<li>Only one card can be placed on the field each turn.</li><br>
<li>When a monster attacks a defending monster in Attack Position, deduct the attacking monster's Attack Points from the defending monster's Defense Points.</li><br>
<li>If the defending monster is destroyed and in Defense Position, no life points are deducted.</li><br>
<li>If the defending monster's Defense Points exceed the attacking monster's Attack Points, the difference is deducted from the attacking player's life points.</li><br>
<li>If a player has no monsters on their side of the field, an attacking monster inflicts direct damage to the opponent's life points equal to its attack points.</li><br>

<h3>Card Types:</h3>
<li>Monsters: Used for battles and fusions.</li>
<li>Equip Cards: Enhance the abilities of monsters.</li>
<li>Trap Cards: Activate special effects in response to specific conditions.</li>
<li>Arcane Cards: Include magic spells, field cards, and equipment cards.</li>

<h3>Game Flow:</h3>
<li>Players can use as many cards as they want from their hand in the fusion process.</li>
<li>At the end of each turn, players draw cards to replenish their hand to 5 cards.</li>
<li>If a player cannot draw cards due to an empty deck, the game ends, and the opponent wins.</li>
